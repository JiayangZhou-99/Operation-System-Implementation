/* Programming Assignment 2: Exercise A
 *
 * In this first set of exercises, you will study a simple program that
 * starts three processes, each of which prints characters at certain rates.
 * This program will form the basis for experimenting with scheduling
 * policies, the main subject for this programming assignment.
 *
 * The function SlowPrintf(n, format, ...) is similar to Printf, but
 * takes a "delay" parameter that specifies how much delay there should
 * be between the printing of EACH character.  The system is calibrated
 * so that n=7 produces a delay of roughly 1 sec per character.  An increase
 * in n by 1 unit represents an increase in delay by roughly a factor of 2
 * (so n=8 produces a 2 sec delay, and n = 5 produces a 250 msec delay).
 *
 * Run the program below.  Notice the speed at which the printing occurs.
 * Also notice the order in which the processes execute.  The current
 * scheduler (which you will modify in other exercises) simply selects
 * processes in the order they appear in the process table.
 *
 *
 * Exercises
 *
 * 1. Modify the delay parameters so that process 1 prints with delay 8
 * (more than process 2), and process 3 prints with delay 6 (less than
 * process 2).  Notice the speed and order of execution.
 *
 * 2. Try other delay values and take note of speeds and orders of execution.
 * What are the smallest and largest values, and what are their effects?
 *
 * 3. Now repeat steps 1 and 2, but this time MEASURE your program using
 * the Gettime() system call, which returns the current system time
 * in milliseconds.  To compute the elapsed time, record the current time
 * immediately before the activity you want to measure (e.g., SlowPrintf)
 * and immediately after, and then take the difference of the former from
 * the latter:
 *
 *	int t1, t2;
 *
 *	t1 = Gettime();
 *	SlowPrintf(7, "How long does this take?");
 *	t2 = Gettime();
 *
 *	Printf("Elapsed time = %d msecs\n", t2 - t1);
 *
 * Do the times you measure correspond to the observations you made in
 * steps 1 and 2?  What is the resolution of Gettime() (i.e., what
 * is the smallest unit of change)?  Note that this can be different from
 * Gettime()'s return value units, which are milliseconds.
